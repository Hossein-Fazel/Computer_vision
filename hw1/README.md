### Exercise 1 - Digital Image Processing

This folder contains the solution to the first exercise of the Digital Image Processing course. The exercise explores various image processing techniques using Python and OpenCV, such as zooming, contrast enhancement, histogram equalization, and transformations. The following sections describe the steps performed in each question and how to run the code.

### Questions Overview

1. **Image Zooming**:

   * Implemented pixel replication and zero-order hold methods to zoom in an image by a factor of 2.
   * Discussed the pros and cons of each method and displayed the zoomed images.
   * Proposed an improved zooming method and compared the results.

2. **Contrast Enhancement**:

   * Applied logarithmic and gamma correction methods to enhance the contrast of a low-contrast grayscale image.
   * Plotted histograms of the original and enhanced images for comparison.

3. **Histogram Equalization**:

   * Performed histogram equalization on an image to enhance its contrast.
   * Displayed the original and equalized images along with their histograms.

4. **Image Transformation**:

   * Translated and rotated specific objects within an image and showed the before and after transformations.

5. **Skeletonization**:

   * Applied different functions to modify a skeletonized image and discussed the results.
