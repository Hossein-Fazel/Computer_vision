# Computer Vision Course ‚Äì Assignments and Projects

This repository contains the assignments, exercises, and projects completed as part of my **Computer Vision** course. The goal is to explore fundamental and advanced concepts in computer vision through hands-on implementation using Python and popular libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy and Matplotlib

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- Each assignment or project is organized in its own folder.
- Folders typically include:
  - A document of assignments or project
  - Source code (`.py`, `.ipynb`, etc.)
  - Required datasets or sample images

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## üìù How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hossein-Fazel/Computer_vision.git
   cd Computer_vision
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   You need to install the required Python libraries, such as OpenCV and Matplotlib, to run the code.
  
   if you are using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    if you are using `uv`:

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

3. **Run the Python Scripts**:

   `python`

   ```bash
    python -m notebook     # run .ipynb files
    python /path/to/.py    # run .py files
   ```

   `uv`

   ```bash
    uv run python -m notebook # run .ipynb files
    uv run /path/to/.py       # run .py files
   ```
